<p>“Sam, Tabby, and I are going to camp out back of Tabby’s grandfather’s place tonight.”, I yelled to my parents as I went down the basement stairs to my room.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The door to the basement was only a few feet from the front door, so most times, I could make it down the stairs before my parents realized I was home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This time, though, I needed to get moving quickly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Might as well get the story out there first.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Everything depended on the three of us making it to the site before sundown.</p>
<p class="p1">“Hi, Cat, glad you’re home,” my mother yelled from somewhere vaguely upstairs. “It’s been a long time since you three went camping,”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was still halfway down the stairs and stopped.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I couldn’t tell my parents the real reason.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They are both such nice people; they might smile and nod or lock me in a nuthouse. Instead, I told them a little white lie.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Tab just broke up with Jess,” I said, though that had happened almost two weeks before. I wasn’t much of a sharer, so I was sure I hadn’t told my parents.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Especially since their breakup had involved Jess trying to kill her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As I said, my parents are nice people, so I wasn’t going to worry them with our life and death struggles. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was nothing they could do, but they wouldn’t see it that way. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Knowing would just put them in danger.</p>
<p class="p1">“I’m so sorry,” my mother said, rounding the corner and standing at the top of the stairs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her curly brown hair was mussed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the middle of making dinner, she was wearing a blue apron with a duck on it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My little brother had bought it for her for Christmas. “How is she doing?” she asked, her eyes wide, her mouth making a frown of concern.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Now I could smell the onions that she was cooking.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My stomach rumbled, thinking of all the possible dinners she might make. But I had no time; I would have to forgo food for a little while longer and sleep.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>God, I needed just 30 minutes to sleep.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Instead, I try to put on a brave face. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“She’s doing good, Mom, just a little sad.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Jess turned out to not be a nice person”, I said; that was honest, at least, given the knife and the attempted stabbing.</p>
<p class="p1">My mother looked in the direction of the kitchen. “I’ve got to stir the onions. Are you going to stay for dinner?” she said, disappearing from view.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I wanted to.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was so hungry and tired. I just wanted my normal life back.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">“No, thanks, Mom, but Tab said she wants to binge, so I’m picking up junk food!” I yelled up the stairs as I continued descending them.</p>
<p class="p1">“OK,” my mom said, probably from the kitchen now. She said something else, but I missed it. Finally, reaching the bottom of the stairs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I made my way to my room next to the furnace.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I closed and locked my door.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Under my bed was The Trunk. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It had taken the three of us months to find it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After we had cleaned the mud off, it revealed a green surface.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The material is something I’ve never seen or felt.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It feels like fuzzy leather and smells wonderful, like when it stops raining on a warm summer day. At first, I thought it was something in the mud we washed off, but it never seems to lose that smell, no matter how long it’s been down here.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The green skin is marred in more places than I can possibly count.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I think it’s from years of attempts to open the trunk forcefully, but I don’t know.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I hope that I won’t become so desperate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I pull out the words that Tab risked her life to get from Jess. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
